“I’m Rohith, an engineering graduate with a strong passion for VLSI design and semiconductor technologies.
My interest in this field comes from hands-on project work rather than just theory. I’ve worked on several
digital VLSI projects such as a pop counter, elevator controller, and a full adder implemented through the
complete ASIC flow using Synopsys tools during a workshop, where I gained practical exposure to synthesis,
timing analysis, and design flow concepts.

Along with this, I have hands-on experience in Verilog and Cadence Virtuoso, and I’m comfortable working 
across the design and verification stages. I enjoy understanding how logic translates from RTL to silicon,
which is why I focus on writing clean, optimized designs rather than just making the code work.

In terms of achievements, I secured the 60th rank in DCET, which reflects my strong fundamentals and 
consistency. I also completed NCC during my academics and cleared the B-grade certificate in my first 
attempt, being the only one among five members to do so, which helped me develop discipline, leadership, 
and time-management skills.

Overall, I see myself as a motivated learner with a strong interest in VLSI, a hands-on approach to projects,
and the discipline to perform well in challenging environments. I’m now looking for an opportunity where 
I can grow as a VLSI engineer while contributing effectively to real-world design challenges.”
